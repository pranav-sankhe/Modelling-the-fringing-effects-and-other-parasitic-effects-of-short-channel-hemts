#Parasitic Capacitance in short channel mosfets

Now-a-days the length of conducting paths inside of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) have reached the tunneling limit for electrons resulting in increase in leakage current which is of course not desirable. To overcome this problem we need to scale the permittivities of dielectrics to preventthe tunnelling of electrons. However increasing the permittivity will result in dielectric thickness comparable to the device gate length resulting inincreased fringing fields  from the gate to the source/drain regions.

So we are gonna derieve a simple expression to include this parasitic(extra) capacitance in the capacitance associated with the bottom edge of the gate elctrode.
